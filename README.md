🏠 House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
🚀 Introduction
Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! This tool harnesses the power of a linear regression model to predict house prices based on critical features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. Whether you're a real estate agent, a buyer, or a seller, this project delivers actionable insights to navigate the housing market with confidence. 🏡✨
📊 Dataset
Our model is built on a robust dataset packed with house-related details:

Square Footage: Total living area of the house.
Number of Bedrooms: Total count of bedrooms.
Number of Bathrooms: Total count of bathrooms.
Price: The target variable reflecting the house’s market value.

This rich dataset forms the backbone of our predictive model’s training and evaluation. 📈
🔍 Methodology
We’ve adopted a clear, step-by-step approach to ensure reliable predictions:

Data Preprocessing:
🧹 Clean the data by addressing missing values.
🔄 Encode categorical variables for seamless model integration.
📏 Normalize numerical features for consistency.


Data Splitting:
✂ Divide the dataset into training and testing sets for effective evaluation.


Model Training:
🧠 Train a linear regression model to reveal relationships between features and prices.


Model Evaluation:
📉 Assess performance with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.



📈 Results

🎯 The model boasts an R-squared value of X.XX, explaining XX% of the variance in house prices.
🔑 Top predictors like square footage and number of bedrooms play a major role in determining property value.
