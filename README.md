🏠 House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
🚀 Introduction
Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! This exciting tool taps into the power of linear regression to forecast house prices using key factors like square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. Whether you’re a real estate pro, a curious buyer, or a savvy seller, this project equips you with clear, actionable insights to conquer the housing market. 🏡✨

📊 Dataset
Our model thrives on a dynamic dataset filled with essential house details:  

Square Footage: The total living space of the house.  
Number of Bedrooms: How many bedrooms the house offers.  
Number of Bathrooms: The total bathroom count.  
Price: The house’s market value—the number we’re predicting!

This dataset powers our model’s training and testing, delivering reliable results. 📈

🔍 Methodology
We’ve crafted a straightforward, effective process to ensure top-notch predictions:  

Data Preprocessing:  

🧹 Tackle missing values to keep the data spotless.  
🔄 Convert categorical variables for smooth model use.  
📏 Standardize numerical features for uniformity.


Data Splitting:  

✂ Split the data into training and testing sets to validate performance.


Model Training:  

🧠 Teach the linear regression model to connect features to prices.


Model Evaluation:  

📉 Measure success with Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics.




📈 Results

🎯 The model scores an R-squared of X.XX, capturing XX% of price variation.  
🔑 Heavy hitters like square footage and bedroom count drive the predictions.
